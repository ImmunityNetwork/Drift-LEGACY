# Drift: About and Contributing
We would love it if you would help contribute! To contribute:

##### Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/ImmunityNetwork/Drift`

##### Install the dependencies
`npm install`

##### Edit botsettings.json
We don't currently need to use the youtube api key so you can ignore that. You can also ignore the idioctic api as that is currently a private api that can be ignored for now. You'll have to comment out the code using some parts. Also ignore the dbl token.
```
{
    "token": "<Put your token here>",
    "prefix": "dr!",
    "yt_api_key": "<REDACTED>",
    "idioticapi": "<REDACTED>",
    "dbltoken": "<REDACTED>"
}
```
##### You should be ready to go!
